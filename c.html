<h1>C programming</h1>

<h2>Negative integer division and remainder (modulo)</h2>

<p>In C99, signed integer division truncates towards zero.
If the result was negative and rounded up, the remainder is negative.
(<a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.html#6.5.5">C99 6.5.5</a>)</p>
    <p>Before C99, division of negative integers can round
up or down (even when both operands are negative).
The remainder can be positive or negative. (<a
href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.html#3.3.5">C89 3.3.5</a>)</p>

<h2>Data types</h2>

<p>Unsigned integers consist of value bits and padding bits.
Incorrect values for padding bits may produce a trap representation.
When all value and padding bits are zero, this has to represent
the integer zero (not a trap representation).</p>
    <p>Each signed integer type has an unsigned counterpart, and
corresponding signed and unsigned representations are related.
One bit in the unsigned type (either a value bit, or a padding bit)
corresponds to the sign bit. Every valid signed representation where
the sign bit is zero represents the same value in the unsigned type
(<a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.html#6.2.6.2p5">C99
6.2.6.2 ¶5</a>). A signed integer may use sign-and-magnitude,
one’s complement, or two’s complement representation.
The representation for negative zero, or the most negative value
for two’s complement, may be defined as a trap representation.</p>
    <p>The <i>unsigned char</i> type cannot have padding bits,
and an array of them can represent the bytes of any object.
Plain <i>char</i> is a distinct type, but otherwise has the same
behaviour as either <i>signed</i> or <i>unsigned char</i>.</p>
    <p>The <i>uint</i>N<i>_t</i> types do not have padding bits;
therefore <i>N</i> must be a multiple of CHAR_BIT.
The <i>int</i>N<i>_t</i> types use two’s complement representation,
and cannot have padding bits nor a trap representation
(<a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.html#7.18.2.1">C99
7.18.2.1</a>).</p>
    <p>The types in each of the following groups have the same size and
alignment, and the same representation for values that they support, and
may be interchanged in function arguments, return values, and unions.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Corresponding signed and unsigned integers</li>
    <li>Qualified (with <i>const</i>, <i>volatile</i>, and/or
        <i>restrict</i>) and unqualified types</li>
    <li>Pointers to <i>void</i> and (signed or unsigned) <i>char</i></li>
    <li>Pointers to qualified and unqualified versions of compatible
        types</li>
    <li>All pointers to structures</li>
    <li>All pointers to unions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pointers</h2>

<p>Pointers to different types are not necessarily compatible, except that
a <i>void</i> pointer can hold a pointer to any type.</p>
    <p>C doesn’t require that a <i>void</i> pointer be able to store a
function pointer. Posix requires that function pointers returned from
<i>dlsym</i> can be stored in its <i>void</i> pointer return type. Before
the 2013 edition (TC1), it required all function pointers be convertable to
<i>void</i> pointers (changed in bug <a
href="http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=74">74</a>).</p>

<h2><i>printf</i></h2>

<p>A string conversion "%s" takes a pointer to a string of <i>char</i>.
If no precision is specified, the string must include a null byte.
If a precision is specified (e.g. "%.*s"), the C standard suggests
the string may not need to be null terminated
