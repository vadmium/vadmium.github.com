<h1>Python</h1>

<p><b>math.ceil</b> could return a <i>float</i> or an <i>Integral</i>
type when passed a <i>float</i>, and should return an <i>Integral</i>
when passed other types. To convert the <i>float</i> to an <i>int</i>,
you can use <i>round</i> without <i>ndigits</i>. To convert
an <i>Integral</i> (including <i>int</i>) to an <i>int</i>, you should
be able to use the <i>int</i> constructor.</p>
    <p><b>round</b> without <i>ndigits</i> converts <i>float</i> to
<i>int</i>. In general it should return an <i>Integral</i>, which
should be convertable to <i>int</i> with the <i>int</i> constructor.</p>

<h2>Regular expressions</h2>

<p>In a character set “[. . .]”, put the closing square bracket “]” at the
start to count as a regular character or the start of a character range.
(Escape it with a backslash, “\]”, also specifies a regular character.)
Put the ASCII hyphen “-” at the end to count as a single character (or
escape it with a backslash, or put it at the start). You cannot have a range
ending in a closing square bracket. The ASCII caret “^” has to be after
the first character to lose its special meaning. The opening
square bracket “[” cannot be the first character in the set.</p>
    <p>Character classes (\d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W) are accepted
within a character set. The escape sequence \b specifies the backspace
control character. It is not clear how to specify a backslash in a
character set. It may be safer to put it as an alternative to the
character set: (?:[. . .] | \\).</p>
