<h1>Python</h1>

<p><b>math.ceil</b> could return a <i>float</i> or an <i>Integral</i>
type when passed a <i>float</i>, and should return an <i>Integral</i>
when passed other types. To convert the <i>float</i> to an <i>int</i>,
you can use <i>round</i> without <i>ndigits</i>. To convert
an <i>Integral</i> (including <i>int</i>) to an <i>int</i>, you should
be able to use the <i>int</i> constructor.</p>
    <p><b>round</b> without <i>ndigits</i> converts <i>float</i> to
<i>int</i>. In general it should return an <i>Integral</i>, which
should be convertable to <i>int</i> with the <i>int</i> constructor.</p>
    <p><b>cgi.parse_multipart</b>(<i>fp</i>, <i>pdict</i>): <i>fp</i> is a
BufferedIOBase reader; <i>pdict</i> is a mapping and must have the lowercase
text key “boundary”, with a value in bytes. The result is different to
<i>parse_qs</i> in that the keys are the field names in text, but the
value list items are byte strings, not decoded to text.</p>
    <p><b>cgi.parse_header</b> works with text strings of the Content-Type
header field format. It returns a tuple of two items; the first is the raw
<i>type/subtype</i> string; the second is a dictionary mapping
<i>attribute=value</i> pairs. Attribute names are converted to lowercase,
and their values are de-quoted.</p>

<h2>Regular expressions</h2>

<p>In a character set “[. . .]”, put the closing square bracket “]” at the
start to count as a regular character or the start of a character range.
(Escaping it with a backslash, “\]”, also specifies a regular character.)
Put the ASCII hyphen “-” at the end to count as a single character (or
escape it with a backslash, or put it at the start). You cannot have a range
ending in a closing square bracket. The ASCII caret “^” has to be after
the first character to lose its special meaning. The opening
square bracket “[” cannot be the first character in the set.</p>
    <p>Character classes (\d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W) are accepted
within a character set. The escape sequence \b specifies the backspace
control character. It is not clear how to specify a backslash in a
character set. It may be safer to put it as an alternative to the
character set: (?:[. . .] | \\).</p>

<h2>configparser</h2>

<p>With <b>ConfigParser.get</b>, there is a keyword-only <i>fallback</i>
parameter. The config option is assumed to exist if no fallback is given.
However the “mapping protocol access” <b>ConfigParser[<i>section</i>].get</b>
method is compatible with <i>dict.get</i>.</p>

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>The <b>time.time</b> function is only guaranteed 1 s precision, and on
Unix the epoch and whether leap seconds are considered can vary. On the other
hand, <b>datetime.datetime.now</b> is supposed to have better precision where
possible.</p>

<h2>HTTP cookies</h2>

<p><b>http.cookies</b> is for HTTP servers, and can parse the Cookie
header field.</p>
    <p><b>http.cookiejar</b> is for HTTP clients. <b>CookieJar</b> holds
cookies for various scopes (domains, paths, etc). <b>Cookie</b> holds
a single cookie record, including its name, value, and attributes. Cookie
has no documented constructor; instead it is recommended to convert a HTTP
response to a sequence of Cookie instances using a CookieJar method.</p>
