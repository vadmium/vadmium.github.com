<h1>Python</h1>

<p><b>math.ceil</b> could return a <i>float</i> or an <i>Integral</i>
type when passed a <i>float</i>, and should return an <i>Integral</i>
when passed other types. To convert the <i>float</i> to an <i>int</i>,
you can use <i>round</i> without <i>ndigits</i>. To convert
an <i>Integral</i> (including <i>int</i>) to an <i>int</i>, you should
be able to use the <i>int</i> constructor.</p>
    <p><b>round</b> without <i>ndigits</i> converts <i>float</i> to
<i>int</i>. In general it should return an <i>Integral</i>, which
should be convertable to <i>int</i> with the <i>int</i> constructor.</p>
    <p><b>cgi.parse_multipart</b>(<i>fp</i>, <i>pdict</i>): <i>fp</i> is a
BufferedIOBase reader; <i>pdict</i> is a mapping and must have the lowercase
text key “boundary”, with a value in bytes. The result is different to
<i>parse_qs</i> in that the keys are the field names in text, but the
value list items are byte strings, not decoded to text.</p>
    <p><b>cgi.parse_header</b> works with text strings of the Content-Type
header field format. It returns a tuple of two items; the first is the raw
<i>type/subtype</i> string; the second is a dictionary mapping
<i>attribute=value</i> pairs. Attribute names are converted to lowercase,
and their values are de-quoted.</p>

<ul>
<li>valid: [-. . .] [. . .-] [. . .\-. . .] (include hyphen in set rather than specify a range)
<li>A plain hyphen as the start or end of a range would be ambiguous, and would conflict with a reserved possible future use of a double literal hyphen sequence.
<li>ranges: [. . .-\-. . .] [. . .\--. . .]
<li>lone character ]  []. . .]  or  [. . .\]. . .]
<li>range from ]  []-. . .]  or  [. . .\]-. . .]
<li>range to ]  [. . .-\]. . .]
<li>opening [ at start conflicts with reserved possible future notation  [. . .[. . .] [\[. . .]
<li>circumflex must not be first character: [. . .^. . .]
</ul>

<ul>
<li>- start or end
<li>] start
<li>[ not at start
<li>^ not at start
<li>[-]  []]  [\[]  ^
<li>[]-]  [-[]  [-^]
<li>[][]  []^]  [\[^]
<li>[][-]  []^-]  [-^[]  [][^]
<li>[]. . .^. . .[. . .-]
</ul>

Rules:
<ul>
<li>1. Put literal closing square bracket (]) at start, or escape with a backslash prefix in complemented sets
<li>2. Put literal hyphen (-) at start, or at end if start position unavailable
<li>3. Put literal caret (^) after start (or don't use square brackets if on its own)
<li>4. Put literal opening square bracket ([) after start after any complementing caret (^), or escaped with a backslash prefix if only the start position is available
<li>Literal hyphens (-) can and both opening and closing square brackets ("[" and "]") can all be escaped with a backslash prefix
</ul>

<p>In a character set “[. . .]”, put the closing square bracket “]” at the
start to count as a regular character or the start[?] of a character range.
(Escaping it with a backslash, “\]”, also specifies a regular character.)
Put the ASCII hyphen “-” at the end to count as a single character (or
escape it with a backslash, or put it at the start). You cannot have a range
ending in a closing square bracket. The ASCII caret “^” has to be after
the first character to lose its special meaning. The opening
square bracket “[” cannot be the first character in the set.</p>
    <p>The six special sequence character classes (\d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W) are accepted
within a character set / character class that uses square brackets
(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#matching-characters"
>How-to</a>). The escape sequence \b specifies the backspace
control character. It is not clear how to specify a backslash in a
character set. It may be safer to put it as an alternative to the
character set: (?:[. . .] | \\).</p>

Unclear if other escape sequences are valid inside square bracket character sets. Better to encode them directly (without raw strings)

<p>With <b>ConfigParser.get</b>, there is a keyword-only <i>fallback</i>
parameter. The config option is assumed to exist if no fallback is given.
However the “mapping protocol access” <b>ConfigParser[<i>section</i>].get</b>
method is compatible with <i>dict.get</i>.</p>
    <p>Section objects (ConfigParser[<i>section</i>]) include getter
converters corresponding to ConfigParser by default: <b>getint</b>,
<b>getfloat</b> and <b>getboolean</b>. Their signatures are compatible with
(<i>key</i>, *, / [, <i>fallback</i>]). (<a

<section id=time>
<h2><a href="#time">Time</a></h2>

<p>The <i>time.<b>time</b></i> function is only guaranteed 1 s precision.
Outside of Windows,
whether leap seconds are considered can vary, and
the zero reference point (“epoch”) can also vary before Python 3.11.
The range can be limited to 1970–2038. On the other
hand, <i>datetime.<b>datetime.now</b></i>
is supposed to have better precision where
possible, and <i>datetime</i> objects have better range
and always count 60 s per minute.</p>

<h2><a href="#time-parsing">Time parsing</a></h2>

<p>For <i>time.strptime</i>, it is implied that non-directive punctuation in
the format string matches corresponding literal punctuation in the parsed
value. It is implied that the format ' %d' can handle a doubled space instead
of a leading zero.</p>

<p>For <i>datetime</i> module <i>strptime</i> methods, many numeric
directives allow a leading zero to be omitted. It is implied that multiple
leading zeros could be omitted, as long as some digits remain. However,
multiple numeric fields should not be bunched up without punctuation unless
all leading zeros are included.</p>

<section id=cookies>
<h2><a href="#cookies">HTTP cookies</a></h2>

<p><b>http.cookies</b> is for HTTP servers, and can parse the Cookie
header field.</p>
    <p><b>http.cookiejar</b> is for HTTP clients. <b>CookieJar</b> holds
cookies for various scopes (domains, paths, etc). <b>Cookie</b> holds
a single cookie record, including its name, value, and attributes. Cookie
has no documented constructor; instead it is recommended to convert a HTTP
response to a sequence of Cookie instances using a CookieJar method.</p>
