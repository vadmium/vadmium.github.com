Ecma-119.pdf: ''Volume and file structure of CDROM for information interchange''

;sector
:Smallest addressable individual part of CD
;Data Field
:User data in a CD sector; e.g. 2048 bytes on a 2352-byte sector
;Logical Sector
:Highest power of two bytes that fits a CD sector data field; minimum 2048&nbsp;B, spanning multiple CD sectors. Numbered from zero.
;System Area
:16 logical sectors (32&nbsp;KiB) reserved at the start of the volume
;Data Area
:Remaining space from logical sector number 16 onwards

;Logical Block
:512&nbsp;B or higher power of two; at most the “logical sector” size. Numbered from zero.
;Extent
:Any continuous series of logical blocks
;File Section
:Part of file data recorded in an extent. Recorded in “data area”; there may be more than one file section per file.
;File Unit
:Continuous sequence of logical blocks in an extent (extent within an extent). File units have uniform size and spacing for a given file section. Aligned to the start of a logical sector. Any extended attribute record spans entire first file unit.
:;size
::Logical blocks
:
;Interleave Gap
:Extra space after each file unit; uniform size for a given file section
;Extended Attribute Record
:May be associated with a file section. If recorded, at beginning of its extent. Spans whole of first file unit in interleaved mode.
:;length
::Logical blocks
:
;Data Space
:The file units (interleaved mode) or extent (non-interleaved mode) subsequent to any extended attribute record. File data recorded beginning at the start of the data space.
:;data length
::bytes; may be less than available

;byte position
:Numbered from one

;Volume Descriptor
;File Descriptor
;Directory Descriptor
;Path Table
:All recorded in “data area”

;volume data area:
:*volume descriptors
:** root directory
:** path table
:*** all directories
:
;directory: must be in a single extent
:* subdirectories
:* file sections
:** [extended attribute record]

== Non-sequential recording (NSR) ==

[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-167.htm ECMA-167] ''Volume and file structure for write-once and rewritable media using non-sequential recording for information interchange

;byte position
:Numbered from zero (different from CDFS)
;numerical values
:Recorded in little endian, two’s compliment

;sector
:Data field of smallest addressable independent part of medium
:;number
::Initial 0
:
;volume recognition area
:Sector-aligned, beginning after first 32&nbsp;KiB of sectors in “volume recognition space”, presumably to correspond with CDFS’s Data Area.
;volume recognition sequence
:Sequence of Volume Structure Descriptors, recorded from the start of the volume recognition area. Terminated by invalid descriptor.
;Volume Structure Descriptor
:Aligned to the start of a sector and padded to the end of its last sector with zeros
:;Standard Identifier (byte position 1; 5 bytes)
::Indicates interpretation of Volume Structure Descriptor. Values mentioned: BEA01, BOOT2, CD001, CDW02, NSR02, NSR03, TEA01.
:;Structure Type (position 0; 1 byte)
:;Structure Version (position 6; 1 byte)
:;Structure Data (position 7; 2041 bytes)
:
;CD-ROM Volume Descriptor Set
:Optional; at start of volume recognition sequence. Details specified by CDFS.
;Extended Area
:All Volume Structure Descriptors except the CD-ROM Volume Descriptor Set must be within an Extended Area. Bracketed by at least one Beginning Extended Area Descriptor and at least one Terminating Extended Area Descriptor.
;Beginning Extended Area Descriptor
:Standard Identifier “BEA01”; Structure Type 0; Structure Version 1; Structure Data zeroed
;Terminating Extended Area Descriptor
:Standard Identifier “TEA01”; Strucutre Type 0; Structure Version 1; Structure Data zeroed
;Boot Descriptor
:Standard Identifier “BOOT2”
