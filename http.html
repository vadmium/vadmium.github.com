<h1>HTTP</h1>

<h2>Minimum support</h2>

<p>For a request, GET and HEAD methods, Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding
fields, chunked encoding. Folded request field support is not required. Since
RFC 2616: “Expect: 100-continue”.</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>With no headers, some responses (including a 200 “Okay” response to a GET)
may be stored in a cache by default. If a response is cacheable and no
freshness expiry time is given, an expiry time may be calculated, e.g.
based on the difference between the Last-Modified and Date response
fields.</p>
    <p>To indicate something should always come from a cache if possible,
set a large expiry time (e.g. <i>max-age=2592000</i> for 30 days).
To prevent something from being stored in a shared cache, if the
Authorization field is not used in the request, a <i>private</i>
response directive should be included.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

</ul>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Cookie names and values are not allowed to contain semicolons, commas,
nor whitespace. The Netscape specification seems to allow quotes as
ordinary characters. RFC 6265 disallows double quotes, except that
the whole value may be enclosed in double quotes. Support for
proper <i>quoted-string</i> values (RFCs 2109 and 2965), where
the string can contain almost anything, backslashes can escape
internal double-quotes, and a backslash at the end of the string is ambiguous
(by accident: <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid3407"
>errata id. 3407</a>), is spotty.</p>
    <p>Avoid cookie names beginning with a dollar sign ($; RFCs 2109
and 2965), or “__Secure-” or “__Host-” (two underscores “_”, one dash “-”; 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02"
>draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02</a>).</p>
    <p>Multiple cookies go into a single Cookie header field separated by
semicolons (rather than commas). For Set-Cookie, multiple cookies
should be given in multiple header fields. (Splitting with commas
could be confusing with the comma in dates.)</p>

<h3>Expires</h3>

    <p>Suggested date formats include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><i>Wdy</i>, <i>DD</i>-<i>Mon</i>-<i>YYYY</i>
        <i>HH</i>:<i>MM</i>:<i>SS</i> GMT
        [format in last Netscape specification]</li>
    <li>Wednesday, 09-Nov-99 23:12:40 GMT
        [example in both Netscape specification versions]</li>
    <li>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 00:02:05 GMT [RFC 6265: <i>rfc1123-date</i>,
        RFC 2616 profile of RFC 1123 update to RFC 822]</li>
</ul>

<p>RFC 6265 gives a generic procedure to parse the date. The date is split
into tokens of digits, letters, and colons (:), so the
comma (,), dashes (-), and spaces in the above formats are
treated as delimiters. The tokens are matched to the day number,
month name, year name, and time components. The order doesn’t matter,
except that the day of the month has to come before the year. The
weekday name and time zone are ignored, and years 99 and less are treated as
1970–2069.</p>

<h2>Cross-origin access</h2>
Browsers restrict some kinds of accesses based on an “origin”. The
scheme, host, and sometimes the port, in a URL determine the origin.
